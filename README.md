SciAlgs contains a set of common scientific algorithms written in a 21st century high-level programming language.
Ideally it would be like a Numerical Recipes of our age. Acomplishing that task would be daunting, 

Some of the aims would be:
* To rewrite some old programs to avoid their obsolescence.
* Provide simple functions to perform basic operations, such that an average researcher can understand.
* Modern development practices: tests, continuous integration, collaborative development, ...
* Make algorithms accessible to researchers without expertise in computer programming.
* Expand the ecosystem of scientific packages in Julia.
